Below is a list of goodies that are being showcased:
Architectural Patterns
User Authentication:
Users can sign up using their Gmail account or create a new account using their email and password.
Firebase Authentication is utilized for secure and seamless user authentication.
Task Management:
Create, edit, and delete tasks with ease.
Tasks are stored in Firebase Firestore for real-time synchronization across devices.
Firebase Integration:
Utilizes Firebase Authentication for secure user authentication.
Firestore database is used to store and retrieve tasks.
Navigation Component (Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app)
Clean Architecture (By employing clean architecture, you can design applications with very low coupling and independent of technical implementation details, such as databases and frameworks. That way, the application becomes easy to maintain and flexible to change. It also becomes intrinsically testable.)
Result (Add Result for Error Handling)
UI Patterns
MVVM (Model View ViewModel)
ViewModel (Architecture Components ViewModel Class)
Kotlin
Kotlin (A modern programming language that makes developers happier)
Kotlin Symbol Processing (Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) is an API that you can use to develop lightweight compiler plugins. KSP provides a simplified compiler plugin API that leverages the power of Kotlin while keeping the learning curve at a minimum. Compared to kapt, annotation processors that use KSP can run up to 2 times faster)
Kotlin Coroutines (Coroutines simplify asynchronous programming by putting the complications into libraries. The logic of the program can be expressed sequentially in a coroutine, and the underlying library will figure out the asynchrony for us)
Android Support
Material Components (Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android)
Dark Theme (Dark theme is available in Android 10 (API level 29) and higher)
Jetpack Compose (Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs)
Build
Gradle Kotlin DSL (Kotlin language support for Gradle build scripts)
Gradle Versions (Gradle plugin to discover dependency updates)
